        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "(i) Classes and Objects:\n",
        "\n",
        "Class: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "Object: An instance of a class. It represents a specific realization of the class with actual values for the attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "(ii) Encapsulation:- Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which means the internal state of an object can only be changed by its own methods. This helps to protect the integrity of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iii) Inheritance:- Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the attributes and methods of an existing class. The new class, called a subclass (or derived class), can modify or add new attributes and methods. This promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "(iv) Polymorphism:- Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It is the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways, typically by overriding methods in derived classes. This concept is useful for implementing functionality that can handle multiple data types or classes seamlessly.\n",
        "\n",
        "(v) Abstraction:- Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It helps to reduce complexity and allows for the easy management of large systems by providing clear, simple interfaces for interacting with objects."
